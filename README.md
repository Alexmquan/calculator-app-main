## Bug
When running the calculation 2 * 1500 then press =, the calculator shows the result is 500, it should be 3000.
Please find and solve this bug. Leave comments in the code to explain your solution.

## Feature
We would like to add a history component that keeps track and displays the last 5 calculations. Please add this to the calculator page. 
It should show up to the right of the calculator (you can make it as styled/plain as you like). It should show the last 5 calculations.
Feel free to add it in where ever/however you would like, we are not looking for perfection. 


## Bonus 
Add something cool. This can be anything you like, theme, feature, animations etc. This is 100% not required and is meant to be fun.
